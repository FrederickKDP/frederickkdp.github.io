> Note: Not a recruiter, looking for a job myself

# Motivation

One of my last courses in my IT program was about how to format in Microsoft Word, and with that, I expected it to be a big asset when I was about to graduate, so I could design beautiful résumés. Little did I know, I likely fell into a trap and lost a lot of valuable time sending documents that nobody read. To hopefully save you from the trouble here are some of the well-known (but sadly, not for me when I started) advice before starting to share your resume around.

# Tips
## 1. ATS Friendly
**ATSs**, Applicant Tracking Systems, are applications that process your resume into the system. Meaning, an ATS friendly resume saves you, and the company some time. I believe there is no "standard" on how to make your resume be ATS friendly, but here's what I do:

1. No tables
2. Use an OS-friendly text fonts [examples](https://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html) .
3. No fancyn elements; like images, or non-standard bullet points. About that, I do not use bullet points either, but many resume builders use them, so they might be ok.

## 2. Prefer recent postings
Some positions can fill quickly, so being an early applicant can help. Usually job boards offer ways to sort by the day that they were uploaded. That doesn't mean you don't have a chance applying late, but is a matter of prioritization.

## 3. Tailor your résumé
Sometimes we have the qualifications, but *not phrased to match the job description* . Also, unrelated qualifications may hurt you more than help, adding a lot of noise that might decrease your chances to be noticed.
Therefore, be sure to read the job description carefully and *pay attention to the keywords* . If the position is asking, "HTML & CSS" for example, rather than having "Web development experience" and assume the person reading will get it, be clear; write "HTML & CSS" if you do have the qualification.

> These are the 3 I see most often around, but here are some personal tips, again, not a recruiter, so take your grain of salt.

## 4. If not already, have a password manager
Very often companies have their own internal job board systems, to which you'll need to register. Instead of juggling multiple passwords and use a manager instead. It's faster and more secure.

## 5. Keep track of your applications
I have a folder with every custom résumé I submit, and save job descriptions that become relevant. This is important when you're contacted back, and you're expected to know exactly what you submitted. If you sent lots of applications, you might forget.
PDF files tend to be small, so spare yourself from the possible embarrassment, and keep track of what you send to others.

## 6. Diversify Applications
Another common phenomenon I see in applicants is to be very rigid. Apply for very similar positions on the same website. While in the perfect world that would be ideal, you should take time to assess what is the extent of your proficiencies, and what are your options. We often overlook our own strengths that could help us landing a job.
Asking an informed friend on what they feel our skills are based on our titles might help a lot on this point.

## 7. Take care of your health
Ok, this is one of those tips everybody ignores, so I'll be brief; Try to resist the temptation and keep good healthy habits, even if is just water over pop. Good for the mind, and might even save you money.

## 8. Network
Maybe another one every one ignores? But take it seriously. If every one is in the same situation as you, it means that's a perfect opportunity to know each other. Of course not all, but many are more than glad to give their opinion for free. And speaking of, last tip for the time being:

## 9. Learn how to give, and listen to harsh feedback
Sometimes we commit mistakes that hurt us a lot, and often, those same mistakes are actually easy to fix, but we don't notice, and nobody tells us. If you see another in this position, ask if they would like to listen, and if it's you who are listening, I know it's hard, but know you don't need to agree nor everything everyone says. Appreciate the intention, and if the advice does bare fruits, follow up with a thank you.

Times of need, are times that require compassion. At worst, you both lost few minutes, at best, you found an important contact that will be grateful for the gesture. You don't need to agree, nor over-extent, just try to improves other's chances as much you want to improve your own. It always comes back.
